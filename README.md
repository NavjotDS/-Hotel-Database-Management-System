# Hotel Database Management System

## Description:
Developed a comprehensive Hotel Database Management System as a term project during my graduate degree at Trent University. The project focuses on conceptualizing, designing, and implementing a relational database model to effectively manage various aspects of hotel operations, including properties, employees, customers, amenities, and restrictions.

## Key Contributions:

- **Conceptual Model Design:** Designed the conceptual model, identifying entities, relationships, and attributes essential for effective database management.
- **Relational Data Model Implementation:** Implemented a robust relational data model using SQL, defining tables, primary keys, foreign keys, and establishing relationships to ensure data integrity and efficiency.
- **Data Population and Query Execution:** Populated the database with relevant data using SQL insert queries and executed complex SQL queries for data retrieval and reporting purposes.
- **Entity-Relationship Diagram Visualization:** Designed and presented an Entity-Relationship diagram to provide a visual representation of the database structure, aiding in understanding and communication.
- **Scalability and Flexibility:** Demonstrated the scalability and flexibility of the database by seamlessly incorporating new entities and relationships without requiring major modifications to the existing data model.

## Skills Demonstrated:
- Database Design
- SQL
- Relational Database Management
